# anki-japanese-tools
A collection of tools to make adding Japanese flashcards to Anki easier.  Import from Kindle, add missing audio, and quickly add cards by providing a list of words.

## Usage
Run either k2a.py (import into Anki from Kindle), add_audio.py (add audio clips from the web to Anki cards that don't have audio yet), or quickadd.py (provide a list of words to quickly add to Anki).

Each script can take a parameter to tell it where the configuration file is, otherwise it assumes 'config.ini' in the current working directory.
